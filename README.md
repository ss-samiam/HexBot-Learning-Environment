# HexBot-Learning-Environment

The algorithms was developed as part of a course (COMP3702 - Artificial Intelligence) I undertook at the University of Queensland.

The algorithms are not stand alone and require 'support code' which has not been uploaded. The code should not run but it serves as a demonstration of my understanding in various basic models used in artificial intelligence.
Algorithms implemeted in the repository contain the following:
+ **Search Algorithms**: Uniform cost search, A-star search
+ **MDPs**: Policy iteration, Value iteration
+ **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning, SARSA

The algorithms are developed for an automatically controlling HexBot, a multi-purpose robot which operates in a hexagonal environment, and has the capability to
push and pull 'Widgets' in order to reposition and rotate them to target locations and orientations.
